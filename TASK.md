# The Coding Challenge

## Requirements 
* We would be very grateful if you could attempt the following ‘Snakes and Ladders Kata’ [coding exercise](http://agilekatas.co.uk/katas/SnakesAndLadders-Kata);
* Please complete the following problem to determine your competency with Scala and Play;
* Use Scala, Play and MongoDB. Place your final solution in a GitHub repository;
* Provide a readme that explains how you have implemented your solution and how to execute it;
* You can use any version of Scala, any libraries, and any frameworks you like;
* You do not have to create any GUI or UI. Outputting to the console or using tests to demonstrate behaviour is fine;
* Please use git and make regular commits as you would when normally creating code.

## Development guide lines
When working through the test, keep in mind that we care about understanding how you would normally write code, although we fully appreciate this is an artificial scenario:
* Please try to write the code as you would for a business critical production application;
* Please record any decisions you made or things you would have done differently if you had more time or if this was a real application;
* If you are unsure at any point about what to do, please make an assumption but make a note so that we understand why you made the assumption;
* If you want to show off your advanced knowledge of Scala, please create a separate branch so that it doesn’t look like your solution is over-engineered.
